# Introduction

This is my own development, many technologies that I had to deal with in my work are concentrated in this repository. All this is designed in the form of a telegram bot for convenience and visual demonstration.

# Core

Here will be a description of root services, adapters and controllers

### Docker

Description of the Dokerfiles and the launch of the project

# Architecture

There will be a link to miro with a ready-made architecture when the project is at the "visualization required" stage. Until then, I do not see the point in preparing a scheme, since I do not know in advance with which libraries and in what form it will work.

# Usings

Documentation on the use of the bot in telegram, as well as integration with API

# Used libraries

List of used libraries with possible notes by version
